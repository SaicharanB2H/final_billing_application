### Dependencies Used
- `mobile_scanner: ^5.2.3` - Barcode scanning
- `provider: ^6.1.2` - State management
- `sqflite` - Database operations

### Key Functions
```dart
_scanInventoryItem()          // Opens scanner dialog
_extractPurityValue()         // Converts purity string to number
_generateBill()               // Creates invoice + updates inventory
markItemAsSold()              // Updates inventory status
```

### Data Flow
```
Scan Barcode → Get SKU → Query Database → 
Validate Item → Add to Bill → Generate Invoice → 
Mark as Sold → Create Transaction Log → 
Generate PDF → Refresh Dashboard
```

## 📱 Camera Permissions

### Android
Already configured in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

### iOS
If deploying to iOS, add to `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Camera is required to scan item barcodes</string>
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "Item not found: GOLD-RING-001"
**Cause**: Item doesn't exist in inventory database
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Inventory → All Items
2. Verify the SKU exists
3. Check if item was deleted

### "Item already added to the bill"
**Cause**: You're scanning the same item twice
**Solution**: Each bill item must have a unique SKU

### "Item is not available for sale (Status: Sold)"
**Cause**: Item was already sold or issued
**Solution**:
1. Go to Inventory → Item Details
2. Check the item's current status
3. Update status if needed (or select a different item)

### Camera not opening
**Cause**: Permission denied
**Solution**:
1. Go to device Settings → Apps → Price Calculator
2. Enable Camera permission
3. Restart the app
