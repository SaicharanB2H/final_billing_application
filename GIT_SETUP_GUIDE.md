# Git Setup & Workflow Guide

## ✅ Repository Successfully Configured!

Your repository is now properly configured with `.gitignore` and all build files have been removed from Git history.

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### 1. Created `.gitignore` File
A comprehensive `.gitignore` file was created that excludes:
- ✅ Build outputs (`/build/`, `/android/app/build/`)
- ✅ IDE files (`.idea/`, `.vscode/`)
- ✅ Generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`)
- ✅ Sensitive files (`*.jks`, `*.keystore`, `key.properties`)
- ✅ Database files (`*.db`, `*.sqlite`)
- ✅ APK/AAB files (`*.apk`, `*.aab`)
- ✅ Platform-specific build artifacts

### 2. Cleaned Git History
- Removed all large build files from Git history using `git filter-branch`
- Cleaned up repository with `git gc --aggressive`
- Successfully pushed clean history to GitHub

### 3. Enhanced README
- Added professional badges and formatting
- Detailed feature descriptions
- Comprehensive installation instructions
- Project structure documentation
- Usage guide and examples

## 🚀 Daily Git Workflow

### Before You Start Working
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin master
```

### Making Changes
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add files (only source code, not builds)
git add lib/ android/app/src/ pubspec.yaml

# Or add all (gitignore will filter)
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin master
```

### Building the App
```bash
# Clean previous builds
flutter clean

# Build for release
flutter build apk --release
# or
flutter build appbundle --release
```

**Important:** Build files are automatically ignored and won't be committed!

## ⚠️ Files You Should NEVER Commit

These are already in `.gitignore`, but be aware:

### 🔴 Build Outputs
- `build/` folder
- `android/app/build/` folder
- `*.apk`, `*.aab`, `*.ipa` files

### 🔴 Sensitive Information
- `*.jks` or `*.keystore` (signing keys)
- `key.properties` (keystore configuration)
- `google-services.json` (Firebase config)
- `.env` files with API keys

### 🔴 IDE & System Files
- `.idea/` (Android Studio)
- `.vscode/` (VS Code)
- `.DS_Store` (macOS)

### 🔴 Dependencies
- `android/.gradle/`
- `.dart_tool/`
- `.packages`

## 📦 What You SHOULD Commit

### ✅ Source Code
- All files in `lib/`
- `pubspec.yaml` and `pubspec.lock`
- Android/iOS configuration files (`build.gradle`, `Info.plist`)
- Assets (`images/`, `fonts/` if you have them)

### ✅ Documentation
- `README.md`
- Implementation guides (`.md` files)
- Code comments

### ✅ Configuration
- `analysis_options.yaml`
- `android/app/src/` (source files only)
- `ios/Runner/` (configuration only)

## 🔧 Useful Git Commands

### Check what will be committed
```bash
git status
git diff
```

### Undo uncommitted changes
```bash
# Discard changes to a file
git checkout -- <file>

# Discard all changes
git reset --hard
```

### View commit history
```bash
git log --oneline
git log --graph --oneline --all
```

### Create a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

### Merge a branch
```bash
git checkout master
git merge feature/new-feature
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "File too large" error
This shouldn't happen anymore, but if it does:
1. Make sure the file is in `.gitignore`
2. Remove it from Git: `git rm --cached <file>`
3. Commit and push

### Accidentally committed build files
```bash
# Remove from staging
git reset HEAD <file>

# If already committed
git rm --cached <file>
git commit -m "Remove build file"
```

### Repository too large
```bash
# Clean up
flutter clean
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
```

## 📚 Best Practices

1. **Commit Often**: Small, focused commits are better than large ones
2. **Write Clear Messages**: Describe what and why, not how
3. **Pull Before Push**: Always pull latest changes before pushing
4. **Review Changes**: Use `git status` and `git diff` before committing
5. **Use Branches**: Create feature branches for major changes
6. **Keep Sensitive Data Out**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or keystores

## 🎯 Quick Reference

```bash
# Daily workflow
git pull                          # Get latest changes
# ... make your changes ...
git add .                         # Stage changes
git commit -m "Your message"      # Commit
git push                          # Push to GitHub

# Before building
flutter clean                     # Clean build files

# Building
flutter build apk --release       # Build APK
flutter build appbundle --release # Build AAB
```

**Remember:** The `.gitignore` file is now protecting your repository from accidentally committing build files. As long as you don't modify it, you should be safe!
