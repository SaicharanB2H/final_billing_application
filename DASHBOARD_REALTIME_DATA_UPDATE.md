# Dashboard Real-Time Data Implementation

## Overview
The dashboard sales overview and statistics have been updated to display **real-time data from the database** instead of static hardcoded values.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Dashboard Provider (`lib/providers/dashboard_provider.dart`)
- **New file**: Manages real-time dashboard statistics
- **Features**:
  - Fetches data from SQLite database using existing `getDashboardData()` method
  - Provides getters for all dashboard metrics
  - Includes loading states and error handling
  - Implements refresh functionality
  - Formats currency values properly

### 2. Updated Main App (`lib/main.dart`)
- Added `DashboardProvider` to the provider list
- Ensures dashboard data is available throughout the app

### 3. Updated Dashboard Screen (`lib/screens/dashboard/dashboard_screen.dart`)
- **Initialization**: Loads dashboard data on screen mount
- **Sales Overview Section**: 
  - Now uses `Consumer<DashboardProvider>` to reactively display:
    - Today's Sales (amount + invoice count)
    - This Month's Sales (amount + invoice count)
  - Shows loading indicator while fetching data
  
- **Quick Stats Section**:
  - Displays real-time data for:
    - Total Customers count
    - Total Products count
    - Pending Bills count
    - Pending Amount (formatted currency)
    
- **Added Refresh Button**: 
  - New refresh icon in AppBar
  - Manually refreshes all dashboard data
  - Shows success snackbar on refresh

### 4. Updated New Bill Screen (`lib/screens/billing/new_bill_screen.dart`)
- Automatically refreshes dashboard data after successfully creating a new bill
- Ensures sales overview updates immediately when user returns to dashboard

### 5. Updated Bills History Screen (`lib/screens/billing/bills_history_screen.dart`)
- Refreshes dashboard data when payment status is updated to "PAID"
- Keeps dashboard statistics in sync with invoice changes

## Database Integration

### Dashboard Data Query
The existing `getDashboardData()` method in `DatabaseHelper` calculates:
- **Today's Sales**: Sum of invoices from today (excluding cancelled)
- **Month's Sales**: Sum of invoices from current month (excluding cancelled)
- **Customer Count**: Total active customers
- **Product Count**: Total products in catalog
- **Pending Bills**: Count and total amount of invoices with 'pending' status

### Real-Time Updates
Dashboard data refreshes in these scenarios:
1. **On Dashboard Load**: Initial data fetch when dashboard opens
2. **After Creating Bill**: Automatic refresh when new invoice is saved
3. **After Status Update**: Refresh when payment status changes to PAID
4. **Manual Refresh**: User can tap refresh button in AppBar

## UI Features

### Loading States
- Shows circular progress indicator while fetching data
- Prevents UI flickering with smart loading state management

### Error Handling
- Displays error messages if data fetch fails
- Gracefully handles database connection issues

### Currency Formatting
- Proper Indian Rupee (₹) formatting with comma separators
- Example: ₹1,25,000

## Benefits

✅ **Accurate Data**: Dashboard always shows current database state  
✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Reflects changes immediately after transactions  
✅ **Better UX**: Users see actual business metrics, not dummy data  
✅ **Offline Capable**: Works entirely with local SQLite database  
✅ **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing  

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create New Bills**: Verify dashboard updates after bill creation
2. **Update Payment Status**: Check that pending amount decreases when bills are marked as paid
3. **Add Customers/Products**: Ensure counts update correctly
4. **Refresh Button**: Test manual refresh functionality
5. **Empty Database**: Verify all values show 0 when no data exists

## Future Enhancements

- Add date range filters for sales overview
- Include sales trends/charts using the FL Chart library
- Show top customers/products
- Add export functionality for dashboard reports
- Implement caching for better performance
